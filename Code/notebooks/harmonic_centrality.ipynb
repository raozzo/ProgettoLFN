    "### Implementation notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some considerations about the implementation strategies adopted by the following algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both the CPU and GPU versions are implementations of the HyperBall algorithm from [Boldi and Vigna, 2013]\n",
    "* Since Harmonic Centrality measures how reachable a node is from other nodes, the algorithm works on the transposed graph (`G.reverse()`)\n",
    "* Counters are stored in a matrix of registers: on the CPU version, each register is stored as a `uint8` to minimize RAM usage (this is enough, since it has to store the number of trailing zeroes in a 128-p bits hash); on the GPU version, each register needs to be stored as a `int32` to ensure compatibility with the `cuPy`\n",
    "library\n",
    "* Both implementations simultaneously update the registers using numpy.maximum.at and cupy.maximum.at, based on the values of source nodes\n",
    "* The iteration stops when the cariation in the cardinality estimate between two consecutive steps drops below a tolerance threshold or when a high iteration litmit is reached."
